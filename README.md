# Notes
- `Utils` Add functions that you use frequently  
- `@ensure_annotations` Decorator to ensure that the return value is of the same type
- `@classmethod` only available for the class but not for the instance of class
- `@staticmethod` donot requried any information of the instance. like in simple term donot require self argument
- `git merge --squash <brnach name>`
- `git rebase <branch name>`
- `@property` This is for the hidden function and we can access the hidden function withour the paranthesis 
- `os.path.dirname` It will ignore the last filename and return the remaining path
- `Pipeline` Pipeline is before the training. Callback is during the training that's why we haven't made any separate pipeline
